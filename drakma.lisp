  "This function wraps drakma's new http-request-async function so you don't
   have to deal with the intricacies. For full documentation on this function,
   refer to the docs for drakma:http-request; this library aims to be API
   compatible with drakma.

   This function returns a cl-async future, which is finished with the following
   values of the request (once it returns):
     (body status headers uri stream must-close status-text)

   This means drakma-async is a prime candidate for using the cl-async future
   macros: http://orthecreedence.github.com/cl-async/future#nicer-syntax"
