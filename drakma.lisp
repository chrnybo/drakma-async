  "This function wraps drakma's new http-request-async function so you don't
   have to deal with the intricacies. For full documentation on this function,
   refer to the docs for drakma:http-request, since most parameters are the
   same. There are a few parameters that are controlled by this function fully,
   in particular:
     :close
       Always set to nil. This function will handling closing.
     :want-stream
       Always set to nil. We'll use our own stream.
     :stream
       We pass in our own stream, so you are not allowed to.

   This function returns a cl-async future, to which one or more callbacks can
   be attached. The callbacks must take the same arguments as the return values
   of drakma:http-request:
     (body status headers uri stream must-close status-text)

   The callbacks will be called when the request completes."
