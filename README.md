drakma-async
============
This is a port of the wonderful [drakma](http://weitz.de/drakma/) library to run
on top of [cl-async](https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async).

### Please don't use this yet
This has only been minimally tested. It requires both the `future` and `stream`
branches (merged) of [cl-async](https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async).

__It is highly experimental.__

I plan to do a lot more testing and polishing on it before publishing, so
consider it pre-alhpa for now.
